# Gmecord

Gmecord is a simple Discord bot/Spark webserver that connects a Discord channel and a Groupme chat. 

## What's working
* The following Groupme attachment types will be parsed to Discord:
	* Images
	* Locations

* Mentioning Discord users. (case-sensitive)
* Mentioning Groupme users. (case-sensitive)

## What isn't
* Images uploaded to Discord aren't uploaded to Groupme's service. They will just be links in the message.
 
## Builds
Builds should be posted to [Jenkins.](https://jenkins.banditoz.io/job/gmecord/)
